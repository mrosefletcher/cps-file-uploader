session management??
user select a local file, upload please
sent to chosen s3 bucket in a subfolder reflecting username, filename is provided by user
user gets error/success or in progress

universal character set for uploaded filename
what does S3 allow? can it be converted nicely?
test file size max
	what happens if only part of the file gets uploaded?
	"Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket. "

can the user upload more than one file? sure

change x to actually remove file before upload
change file array to dict
alert user to max file size

add tooltips?
why cant i pick more than one file in the system file browser
